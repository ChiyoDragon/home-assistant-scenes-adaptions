blueprint:
  name: Hue-like Scenes
  domain: script
  description: >-
    This script replicates Hue scenes. Each scene has five different 
    colors
    represented by XY values. These colors are distributed randomly
    on the participating lights (must support XY or RGB color modes) -- each 
    light gets a different color.

    The script can run in two modes, selectable *at runtime*. In mode *once* 
    the script sets the colors once and then stops. In mode *loop*, the script
    repeats continuously, with a delay between iterations. If the script is run
    in loop mode, it can either be terminated by called `script.turn_off` 
    service or by turning off one of the participating lights. 

    The script has various configuration options, described below. The intended 
    setup is to instantiate the blueprint for each area in which it will be run.

    ## Changelog 
    
    ### 2.2
    
    - Transition time is now a blueprint field.
    
    - Repeat delay now has a default value of two minutes.
    
    - Fixed bug in duration format.
    
    
    
    ### 2.1
    
    - The blueprint now contains all the Hue color scenes that are listed [here](https://gist.github.com/Hypfer/a0a8b5b9429831a7306ec4300077eaaa).

    ### 2.0

    - Made into a blueprint. Intended use case: Instantiate blueprint for each area (then they can run independently in parallel).

    - Supports loop mode, a.k.a. dynamic scenes

    - Can exclude lights by manufacturer

    - Select lights by labels
